                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            </header>
            <p> This project is supported by TÜBİTAK under the 1005 program, Project Code: 119S187. The NADA-CPT (Distractor-embedded Auditory Continuous Performance Test) is a novel web-based diagnostic tool specifically designed to assess core clinical symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) such as inattention, response inhibition, hyperactivity, and timing. By integrating auditory and visual distractors, the tool offers a highly ecologically valid approach for diagnosing ADHD in children aged 6-12 years.</p>

                <h2>About the Application</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The NADA-CPT application provides an auditory-based test environment with embedded distractors, simulating real-world attention-demanding scenarios, such as those found in a classroom. This approach enhances the accuracy of ADHD diagnostics and allows for a more comprehensive understanding of attentional challenges in a clinical setting. The use of both visual and auditory distractors helps assess selective attention, impulsivity, and response inhibition, making NADA-CPT a valuable tool in ADHD evaluation.</p>

            <p>The research and development of the NADA-CPT have been published in the <i>Journal of Clinical Medicine</i>, titled "A New Objective Diagnostic Tool for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Development of the Distractor-embedded Auditory Continuous Performance Test." The study demonstrates the reliability and effectiveness of NADA-CPT in diagnosing ADHD by employing auditory stimuli in combination with visual distractions to enhance ecological validity.</p>
